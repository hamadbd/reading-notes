## How will you be evaluated during a coding interview?
I have collated evaluation criteria across top tech companies and generalized them into a coding interview evaluation rubric you can use. Specific terminology or weightages may differ across companies, top tech companies always include the following criteria in their evaluation:

1. Communication - Asking clarifying questions, communication of approach and tradeoffs clearly such that the interviewer has no trouble following.
1. Problem solving - Understanding the problem and approaching it systemically, logically and accurately, discussing multiple potential approaches and tradeoffs. Ability to accurately determine time and space complexity and optimize them.
1. Technical competency - Translating discussed solutions to working code with no significant struggle. Clean, correct implementation with strong knowledge of language constructs.
1. Testing - Ability to test code against normal and corner cases, self-correcting issues in code.
## How to best prepare for a coding interview?
LeetCode by itself is actually not enough to prepare you well for your coding interviews. Diving straight into LeetCode and thinking you can complete all of the thousands of questions is a bad use of your time and will never prepare you as well as a structured approach.

Given 30 min per question and an average of 3 hours practice a day, the average person will only manage to complete 160 questions within 3-4 weeks, and may not internalize the right approach or remember the questions they have practiced before.

Instead, this is how to prepare for your Software Engineer coding interview:

Pick a good programming language to use
Plan your time and tackle topics and questions in order of importance
Combine studying and practicing for a single topic
Accompany practice with coding interview cheat sheets to internalize the must-dos and must-remembers
Prepare a good self introduction and final questions
Try out mock coding interviews (with Google and Facebook engineers)
(If you have extra time) Internalize key tech interview question patterns
