# Linear Regressions In Python Scikit-Learn

Scikit-learn is a Python package that simplifies the implementation of a wide range of Machine Learning (ML) methods for predictive data analysis, including linear regression.

The following are some key concepts you will come across when you work with scikit-learn’s linear regression method:
- Best Fit – the straight line in a plot that minimizes the deviation between related scattered data points.
- Coefficient – also known as a parameter, is the factor a variable is multiplied by. In linear regression, a coefficient represents changes in a Response Variable (see below).
- Coefficient of Determination – the correlation coefficient denoted as 𝑅². Used to describe the precision or degree of fit in a regression. 
Correlation – the relationship between two variables in terms of quantifiable strength and degree, often referred to as the ‘degree of correlation’.  Values range between -1.0 and 1.0. 
- Dependent Feature – a variable denoted as y in the slope equation y=ax+b. Also known as an Output, or a Response. 
Estimated Regression Line – the straight line that best fits a set of scattered data points.
Independent Feature – a variable denoted as x in the slope equation y=ax+b. Also known as an Input, or a predictor. 
- Intercept – the location where the Slope intercepts the Y-axis denoted b in the slope equation y=ax+b. 
Least Squares – a method of estimating a Best Fit to data, by minimizing the sum of the squares of the differences between observed and estimated values.
- Mean – an average of a set of numbers, but in linear regression, Mean is modeled by a linear function.
Ordinary Least Squares Regression (OLS) – more commonly known as Linear Regression. 
- Residual – vertical distance between a data point and the line of regression (see Residual in Figure 1 below).
Regression – estimate of predictive change in a variable in relation to changes in other variables (see Predicted Response in Figure 1 below).
Regression Model – the ideal formula for approximating a regression.
Response Variables – includes both the Predicted Response (the value predicted by the regression) and the Actual Response, which is the actual value of the data point (see Figure 1 below).
- Slope – the steepness of a line of regression. Slope and Intercept can be used to define the linear relationship between two variables: y=ax+b.
Simple Linear Regression – a linear regression that has a single independent variable.
